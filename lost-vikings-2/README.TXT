                     ---------------------------------


1. OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE UNDER WINDOWS 95.

There are three display modes and three frame rate settings which can be
adjusted to optimize you system's performance.
These settings are accessed by clicking the Right Mouse Button on the
Lost Vikings 2 window area.

Lost Vikings 2 defaults to a '640x480' window when running 256 colors,
if you are using 16 bit color it will default to a '320x240' window, however 
selecting a '320x240' window or 'full screen' mode will yield faster 
performance on lower end machines. Likewise, experimenting with a 'medium' 
or 'slow' frame rate will gain smoother results than the default 'fast',
on some machines.

Processor demand and CD access times can also be minimized by setting
'music off' and/or 'speech off', configured on the Lost Vikings 2 
Options screen.

You should also check your Windows Color Mode Setting, accessed by clicking
the Right Mouse Button on the Windows desktop area and selecting 'properties',
then 'settings'.
While Lost Vikings 2 will run in 256 colors or 16 bit color, 256 colors will 
optimize performance. Note also, you cannot run Lost Vikings 2 in Full Screen 
mode while set to high color mode or greater.

****TIP****
If you press the "F4" key, the game will switch from a windowed version of the
game and a Full-screen version of the game.


2. CUSTOMIZING CONTROLLER DEFAULTS.

The Lost Vikings 2 controller defaults are configurable on the 'controls'
screen, accessed via 'options'. To enter a new key choice, move the highlight 
over an "action" using the arrow keys, then press <Space> or <Enter>.
Some key choices are not accepted, so as not to conflict with Windows shortcut 
conventions.

Your settings can be restored to default, by removing the Key95.cfg file (WIN95) 
:\Program Files\Interplay\LV2, or the Key.cfg file (DOS) from 
:\Intrplay\LV2  before running Lost Vikings 2.  Multiple settings may be 
interchanged by moving the Key95.cfg (WIN95) or the Key.cfg (DOS) files to a 
different directory, allowing you to then restore the desired configuration by 
copying it back to the appropriate directory before running Lost Vikings 2.


3. KNOWN PROBLEMS.

* Included on your Lost Vikings 2 CD is an automatic Boot Disk maker. If you
are experiencing problems such as "not enough memory" to run your game type "bootme"
at your cd-rom prompt and follow the on-screen instructions.

* Lost Vikings 2 uses DirectX 3.0. If you have previously installed any version
of DirectX please be sure to let LV2 update your drivers. If this is the first time 
you have used a DirectX product you will need to install the newest available version 
of DirectX (which is located in the Direct3a directory), and then let the installer 
install DirectX off of the cd.

* If you are playing the DOS version of Lost Vikings 2, and experience memory
problems, Run the BOOTME program located in the root directory of your CD.

* Avoid removing the Lost Vikings 2 CD while running!
This situation can be recovered in some circumstances, but it may possibly 
hang your system and require a reboot.

* When running under Windows, avoid Task Switching to another application, 
immediately after launching Lost Vikings 2. Any problems experienced as 
a result of such action can be corrected by briefly defocussing, then 
refocussing Lost Vikings 2.

* Running under Windows with the Desktop sized at 640x480 and Lost Vikings 2 
in full screen mode, <Alt+Tab> or <Ctrl+Esc> can occasionally affect the 
Windows Task Bar 'auto hide' functionality. To correct, briefly defocus, 
then refocus Lost Vikings 2.

* When using an on-the-fly video setting utility you may experience graphics 
glitches with your mouse. If you have such a problem we recommend that you 
disable the utility and re-start your computer before playing.

* If you are using any peripheral devices (such as a joystick) you may
experience some control problems. We recommend that you shut down you computer
and disable or unplug any such devices. Under Windows95 you will have to 
go into control panel and disable your joystick port. 

* Having NUM LOCK enabled may cause control problems on some systems. We recommend
if are experiencing control problems, you first turn off NUM LOCK to see if this 
solves the problem.

* If you have installed Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 and have 'Show 
Contents While Dragging' set in Display Properties, you may experience some 
minor sound or display anomalies when Mouse Dragging the Lost Vikings 2 
window. Most problems will cease when the window is released, and any 
residual effect can be corrected by briefly defocussing, then refocussing 
Lost Vikings 2.
