Physics variables and what they do
----------------------------------

BACKSPACE : Go to physics editor
Curs up/down : Scroll up/down 1 line
Page up/down : Scroll up/down 1 page
Curs left/right : Increment/decrement by 1
Alt + Curs l/r : Increment/decrement slow
Ctrl + Curs l/r : Increment/decrement fast
D : Dump values to file 'values.dat'
ESCAPE : Exit back to game

In general, there are 4 types of values :
1) 3d engine values. Distances/speeds/accelerations. These are in 16bit
		fixed point. I.e. 65536 = 1; 32000 ~= 1/2 etc.
2) 8 bit ratios. A number will be multiplied by this them divided by 256.
	I.e. 256 = 1; 512 = 2; 128 = 1/2; 196 = 3/4 etc.
3) Arbitary. A number that has been produced from testing. Usually linear.
	I.e. number = 300; To double effect, double number.
4) Shift. The relevant value is shifted up or down by this value.
	I.e. number becomes doubled or halved this value times.
