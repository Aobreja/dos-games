Win95:
        There might be some problems when running under Win95 as this
        program wasn't designed to run under any multitasking OS.
        Following problems has been observed:

                Timing problems, so sometimes it slows down.

                Joysticks control freaks out.

                And sometimes a crash when loading. Especialy the last
                3D level (Trench) and the cutscene for the DStar explosion.

        It's recommened to run SSW using a normal DOS boot.
