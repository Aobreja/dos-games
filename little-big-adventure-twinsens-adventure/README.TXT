REQUIREMENTS :

RELENTLESS requires a 486 with a single speed CD-ROM drive.
4MB of memory are required as well as a VESA compliant SVGA card with
512 KB of RAM.

The Recommended Configuration is:

486DX2 - 66 Mhz with local bus (VESA or PCI for example)
Double speed CD-ROM drive
Local bus SVGA card with 1 MB of RAM
8 MB of memory
Sound Blaster 16 (Stereo 16 bits Sound FX + FM Music)


The current "Dream" configuration would be :

Pentium 100 Mhz
Quad speed CD-ROM drive
PCI Local bus SVGA card with 2 MB of RAM
17 inch monitor
8 MB of memory
Sound Blaster AWE32 (Stereo 16 bits Sound FX + Midi Music)

1. Installation

For now, make sure that you have at least 11 MBytes free on your Hard Disk
before installing.

To have all voice files present at the same time (this is not required),
you need 36 MBytes free. If you want to clear these files each time you 
leave the game, select "Keep Speech files on the Hard Drive" (during SETUP) 
to "NO" ("YES" is faster but it takes more space).

This game absolutely requires the CD to be inserted into the CD-ROM Drive 
for normal operation.

4. Tips and Tricks :

- When a character is hit by someone or something a little star indicates 
  the loss of lifepoints. If there is no star when you hit someone, it 
  means you are not strong enough (magic level) or your weapon is not 
  appropriate.
- Don't forget to speak (SPACE BAR in Normal behavior) to people before 
  kicking (or even killing) them (if possible).
- Search in all the closets, trash-cans, chests, and flowers pots to find 
  coins, life, magic, or keys. For example, at one particular stage you will
  need a rather large amount of money to progress.
- When you touch a door without a lock, it will be opened automatically. If 
  the door has a lock you need to use a key. If you don't have a key you 
  must adventure until you find one. (You can see the number of keys you 
  possess in the behavior menu - (By using the CTRL key).
- Keys can be found in closets, flowers pots... or by killing a 
  "monster" (Even doctors!).
- If you know a key was discovered but you can't see it, throw your magic 
  ball. It will bring back any key that could be in the general area.
- Switches can be activated by the magic ball.



5. Troubleshooting


Step A. Configuration

If you are having problems launching the game, make sure that RELENTLESS is
configured properly.
If the problem remains, select VESA and no music and no sound FX and retry.
If the program gives you an error about VESA support, load the VESA driver
provided with your SVGA card (see SVGA card manual).
If the problem is solved go to step F, if not, go to Step B with this 
minimal configuration.


Step B. EMS/UMB provider programs (memory managers)

Try setting up a DOS Boot Disk.  Refer to the DOS Boot Disk section of your 
manual. If the problem is solved go to Step F, if not, go to the next step.


Step C. Caching programs

Try reducing the size of any disk cache such as SMARTDRV.EXE (leave some
cache if possible, even 256 KB or less) in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT.
Eventually try removing any reference to those programs in your CONFIG.SYS
or AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the problem is solved go to Step F, if not, go to the 
next step.


Step D. HIMEM.SYS

Try removing HIMEM.SYS from your Boot Disk CONFIG.SYS. If the problem is 
solved go to Step F, if not, go to the next step.


Step E. Reinstall Relentless

Put the Boot Disk in drive A and reboot using this floppy disk. Then 
re-install Relentless from the CD. If the problem is solved go to step F, 
if not, your computer does not have enough memory to run Relentless.


Step F. Reconfiguration

You can now try to reconfigure your SVGA, Music, and Sound FX cards with the
RELENTLESS setup program.
Enjoy RELENTLESS.



6. Technical information

The best configuration for RELENTLESS would be a machine with HIMEM.SYS 
loaded, no memory manager such as EMM386 or QEMM386, and a disk 
caching program. 
It is best not have anything loaded high since RELENT will make better use
of extended memory than of DOS memory. Therefore, try leaving resident
programs in DOS memory.

RELENTLESS does not use EMS.
