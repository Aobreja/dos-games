
                           I N S T A L L  3 . 7 5 8
Version 3.758

   Added logic to force magicExeFiles to always load low. Changes:
   Made magicExeFiles[] and pointer 'msp" global.
   Added Bool Autoexecline::isMagicExeFile.
   Used isMagicExeFile in WriteAutoexec()


Version 3.757
   8-1-95
   
   Forced bootdisk autoexec.bat to be written in upper case letters by adding strupr
   to function BootFile::ReadLine
   
   Changed driverstruct vesaDriver to magicExeFiles in bootdisk.cpp.
   This was done because of the increasing tendency for add on cards such
   as sound and video to use there own proprietary set up executables.
   This provides a convienent method to force bootdisk to include recongnized
   files in the created autoexec.
 
   Added ssinit.exe, diagnose, aweutil, sb16set, sbconfig. To magicExeFiles

Version 3.756
   7/31/95
   
   Forced smartdrv to use autoexec.bat anytime smartdrv.exe is availible.
   (commented out the install=smartdrv logic).
   
   Made smartdrv command upper case.
   
   Added int smartDriveAmt to hold default cache size value.
   
   Modified -s flag to optionaly set smartdrv cache size in K, Example -s128
   will set cache to 128K
   
   Set smartdrv default to 512K
   
   Commented out call to Rap10Detect in snddetct.s. Some SCSI CDROM systems
   would loss their ability to read CD when this function was called.
   
   Changed order of autoexec.bat construction, to put calls to smartdrv after
   mscdex line (to allow cdrom to be cached).

Version 3.755
   7/30/95
 
   Fixed bug where bootdisk -p was not loading dos high. Now it uses 
   himem.sys to do so.
   

Version 3.754
   7/30/95   
   
   Stopped adding drivers. Fixed uninitiated variable
   foundCDDriver to force original algolrithm to work. Now, once again
   any driver in front of a D: in the config.sys file will be added to
   bootdisk.
   Sound choices presented to user in a order taken from install.hlp again,
   by resolving confict in order which Driverlist and textdict where
   instantiated.
   

Version 3.753

   Added ATAPI_CD.SYS, NEC_CD.SYS, MTMCDAIS.SYS to driver list.
   Made command line switches case insensitive.
   Set Smartdrv to 512K

Version 3.752

   Added NEC_IDE.SYS to needed driver list.
   Fixed bug where bootdisk.exe was ignoring -p option.

Version 3.751
   7/18/95

   Sound card detection code for Sound Blaster AWE32 added.

Version 3.750
   7/14/95   

   Non-Inn version. 
   Fixed the bug that causes the install program to abort when argv[0] != CWD.

   A list of VESA drivers need by Diamond ATI and Video 7 cards was created,
   at some point.. not sure when. 

   BOOTDISK.EXE & INSTALL.EXE share the same version id label.

   Fixed bug where resource.cfg was being written out with a space in front
   of entries like "directory"

   Hardware tests (video speed, cpu speed, cdrom speed) created.

Version 3.748
   6/7/95

   INN version. Checks the path supplied by the user for the existance of 
   certain INN specific files or reports bad path.


Version 3.745
   3/17/95
   
   Updated CD driver names in Bootdisk.cpp to allow users to make a bootdisk
   with their CD drvers included. This could get to be an on going problem.

Version 3.744
   3/14/95

   Smartdrv cache size set to 128k for Alien Legacy. The Kludge of hard
   coding such a small buffer was deemed acceptable because of the assumption
   that this would be the last program to ship with a DOS only install.
   ( Ummm, ya sure ). Also added string to disable write cacheing on dest.
   drive.

                         
Version 3.743
   3/13/95

   Format command now uses /U /V:SIERRA to unconditionaly format and 
   name the bootdisk. Bootdisk also uses smartdrv /X to turn write caching
   off on all drives.
   

Version: 3.742
   2/27/95

   Changed box borders to characters that translate better.

   Changed disk space free report to round down .1 meg instead of up.

   Added feature that allows script writter to display to the user the disk 
   space available on a selected drive. The script writer can now use %7
   which holds the last result of a SPACE script command. Provided the 
   resource.cfg does not have an space = (size) entry, which disables using
   'space' in the script.

   space %1: 1 NO_WHERE

   The 1 and NO_WHERE are dummy variables that force a check for at least 
   1 kb free and jump to label NO_WHERE if the check fails, which it won't. 
   The important thing is %7 get set to a character string containing 
   free space.

   echo drive %1: has %7 megs free

   Will print out something like "drive c: has 54.3 megs free".
   
   Also fixed some destination path parsing bugs. Users who add \ at the 
   end of the destination path will not be punished, users who type a space
   in the path will define end of string at that point and get "bad path"
   message. 

   Rounded up some missing source files and created a makefile. 
   Saddly, using bc 3.1 instead of 4.x oh well.

Version: 3.74

  Added feature that allows you to have two different installation
  sizes.  Instead of using;

     space = (size)

  you can now use;

     polyspac = (small size),(large size)   

  A menu will appear and ask the user to make a selection.
  The users choice is represented in the script file as
  a new variable %6.  It can have values of either BIG or SMALL
  depending on the users selection.  In your script file, you
  would probably have some code that looks like this:
  
  goto %6
  
  :SMALL
    echo installing small version of program
    goto end
  
  :BIG
    echo installing large version of program
    goto end
  
  :end

Version: 3.73

  Fixed some bugs involving SMARTDRv.  There are some differences 
  between how DOS 5.x and 6.x deal with this, that are now working.
  
  Added detection of SBCONFIG.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file for
  sound blaster.  This program is now included in your boot autoexec
  if it was found in your hard drives autoexec.  Absence of this was
  causing SoundSet to crash.
  
  Install no longer duplicates SET=variables in multi-boot autoexec
  files.
  
  Resolved some bugs involving MSCDEX being loaded multiple times in 
  autoexec if multi-boot was used.
  
  Program can resolve between duplicate programs in config.sys and
  autoexec.bat files now.  For instance, if you load mouse.sys in
  config.sys and mouse.com in autoexec.bat, the program only puts
  mouse.sys in the config.sys file.
  
  Fixed a problem where Install was attempting to load your path as
  an executable in autoexec.bat if you had a directory in your path
  called \mouse.
  
  Modified reading of resource.cfg so that its variables and variable
  settings are no longer case-sensitive.  This would cause problems if
  you entered SmartDrv instead of smartdrv, or Yes instead of yes.

Version: 3.72

  Added new .CFG feature to allow you to force SMARTDRV to be
  included in the config.sys file even if the user does not
  originally have it there.  This allows disk-intensive games
  to force SMARTDRV to be loaded.
  
  Fixed a small bug that was not recognizing that you had
  re-inserted the install disk.  It would not allow you to
  rename install.exe to some other file name.
  
  Fixed some bugs relating to CD=yes option.  Install was not
  recognizing MSCDEX loaded in the config.sys file with the 
  INSTALL option, (this is new to DOS 6.x).  It was installing
  the file all the time even if CD=no.  It was also loading the
  driver.sys file when it wasn't supposed to.
                                   
Version: 3.71

  SR941003:  Setting the environment variable %LANGUAGE% to a directory name 
  instructs the install program to read its supporting files from an alternate 
  directory.  This was to facilitate foreign language versions of the programs 
  menu, help text, etc.  Files to be included in this directory are:  .TXT, 
  .HLP, .SCR, .SIP, README, READ.ME, and any other files unique to language
  installation.  The program looks on the foreign directory first before 
  searching in the current directory.


Version: 3.70  

  SR941002:  The program used to stop searching for bootdisk files when it 
  found the first one. Now it continues its search until it finds the one 
  with the most recent date.

  SR941004:  Boot disk operation was not recognizing INSTALL= instructions 
  in the config.sys file and thus it was not loading CD ROM TSR drivers 
  that were being loaded in the config.sys file.  The Boot disk making 
  feature now recognizes INSTALL=.

  SR941005:  Boot disk operation would choke on multi-boot config and 
  autoexec files by adding duplicate entries in the boot disk's config.sys.  
  It now checks to see if the file has already been recognized by the 
  config.sys parser before adding it to the list of files to process.  

********  Support for this program was transferred over to Dynamix, Inc. ****** 

3.690            7/20/94   Use new names for compression files in DOS
                 6.22.
                 
3.680            4/5/94    Recognize MSCDEX replacements NWCDEX and
                 CORELCDX.
                 
3.670            11/21/93  Detect SADL.DRV (Ed Critchlow).
                 
3.661            11/16/93  Copy over CSP.SYS.  Don't load MSCDEX twice
                 unless one of them is loaded high.
                 
3.660            11/14/93  Boot disk maker:  SCI32 protected mode boot
                 disk (doesn't load things high).  Copies SET BLASTER=
                 line.  Doesn't abort if can't find DBLSPACE.DRV.
                 Doesn't use "I=C800-EFFF M3" option to EMM386.
                 Prompt puts our text on line above prompt.
                 Other changes:  Fixed SPACE command in script
                 language to treat argument as unsigned.  Added
                 "mode=" line to RESOURCE.CFG to use for real mode
                 (SCI16) programs (for bootdisk maker's benefit).
                 Better handling of nonexistent or empty drives in
                 drive selection list.
                 
3.648            5/21/93   Boot disk maker:  Make boot disk
                 AUTOEXEC.BAT go to install destination hard disk,
                 instead of COMSPEC disk.  Pause after running FORMAT
                 so user can view FORMAT error messages, if any.
                 
3.647            5/13/93   Boot disk maker: fixed FORMAT command
                 invocation for DOS 3.3.
                 
3.645-6          5/10/93   Boot disk maker:  load mouse driver first.
                 
3.644            4/26/93   Handle checking for disk compression on a
                 write-protected drive.  If no space on drive to test,
                 or if file error, report no compression.  Boot disk
                 maker:  Support DOS 6's DoubleSpace disk compression.
                 Load mouse driver last.  Fixed bug if MSCDEX is
                 loaded but no CD driver is.
                 
3.630            3/25/93   Detect Aria sound driver (Ed Critchlow).
                 
3.620            3/8/93    Source directory wasn't being set properly.
                 Allow SPACE script command if RESOURCE.CFG doesn't
                 contain a "space=" entry.  "directory=" entry was
                 being written twice to RESOURCE.CFG.
                 
3.612            2/25/93   Boot disk maker allows changing to a
                 directory on boot even if a command isn't specified,
                 and vice versa.
                 
3.611            2/23/93   Fixed bug in user defined directory screen
                 where the prompt was not adjusted when the
                 destination drive has been changed.
                 
3.610            2/22/93   Drive selection screen.
                 
3.600            2/16/93   Added the ability for the install to
                 operating using files compressed using the SIP
                 archive format.  The install can also work as normal
                 without any compression at all.
                 
3.590            2/5/93    If MSCDEX specifies more than one CD drive,
                 both will be looked for in the user's CONFIG.SYS and
                 used in the boot disk.  If KEYB is used in user's
                 AUTOEXEC.BAT, it will be used in the boot disk.
                 Fixed bug where 64K EMS was eaten each time program
                 was run.
                 
3.580            1/12/93   The prompt for the user chosen directory
                 now includes the slash built into the prompt.  The
                 user no longer has to provide it.
                 
                      The rest of the changes were for the boot disk
                 maker:  Memory managed boot file lines are detected.
                 Added improved CD device driver recognition.  Low
                 density disk can be formatted in high density drive.
                 EMM386 and HIMEM.SYS now copied to boot disk for
                 compatibility with compressed hard drives.   CD
                 drivers are not loaded unless 'CD=yes' appears in
                 RESOURCE.CFG.  If the game does not require EMS
                 (indicated by lack of 'minEMS=' line in RESOURCE.CFG)
                 the boot disk maker won't direct EMM386 to provide
                 EMS. If the game requires EMS and a CD driver or hard
                 disk manager is loading (requiring more high memory),
                 EMM386  will be run with the I=C800-EFFF M3 option.
                 Lines in AUTOEXEC preceded with '@' are now processed
                 correctly.  MSCDEX, if found, is loaded twice:  once
                 high and once low.  This is because if it fails to
                 load high because of insufficient memory, it won't
                 load low unless we explicitly tell it to.  Program
                 now searches entire floppy disk to make sure the disk
                 with Install is or isn't in the drive.  After boot
                 disk is made, changes back to install directory on
                 floppy.  This allows the boot disk maker to work
                 properly if Install is                 not run from
                 the root directory of the floppy.
                 
3.570            12/17/92  Return an errorlevel from external programs
                 even if output is redirected (we handle all
                 redirection of output now).  Made tab character a
                 delimiter when parsing tokens from script.
                 
3.568            11/24/92  Added support for midnone.drv.
                 
3.567            10/1/92   Install will now detect if you are on a CD
                 drive.  Added support for the Microsoft Windows sound
                 card.
                 
3.566            9/29/92   Updated copyright notice.
                 
3.565            9/27/92   Fixed a bug so disk errors like disengaging
                 a floppy too early will be correctly reported.
                 
3.564            9/15/92   For the moment, the install will not append
                 the 220 usually included on the config file line to
                 indicate the audio port.  A more complete solution is
                 forthcoming.
                 
3.563            9/2/92    Added the /s flag to the copy command. This
                 performs a copy with echoing to the screen.  Fixed
                 the 'if exist' command to now work properly.
                 
3.562            7/23/92   Program now allows user to pick the
                 directory where game files will be placed.  Also
                 added support for the Sound Blaster Pro driver.
                 
3.561            6/15/92   After creating boot disk, prompt to replace
                 boot disk with install disk after prompting to label
                 boot disk.
                 
3.560            6/12/92   After making a boot disk, program asks user
                 to put Install disk back in.  Corrected Gameblaster
                 and SoundBlaster number of voices information in
                 INSTALL.HLP.  Changed help and menu text for EGA640
                 driver so that it doesn't say RGB monitors are
                 supported (Dan Foy).
                 
3.551            6/10/92   Added several more device drivers to be
                 copied when making a boot disk.
                 
3.550a           6/8/92    (TSN) TSN.CFG wasn't being written on a
                 reinstall.
                 
3.550            5/27/92   Support more drivers when creating boot
                 disk.
                 
3.540            5/26/92   Making a boot disk on a '286 with DOS 5.0
                 will load DOS high.
                 
3.531            5/15/92   Boot disk making function can start game if
                 directory and startup command provided in
                 RESOURCE.CFG.  (Version number wasn't incremented.)
                 


3.531a           5/14/92   (TSN) Always write out the password file,
                 instead of having the script do it on an initial
                 install.
                 
3.531            5/13/92   Fixed bug in 'xxx = none' which made
                 program think 'no' == 'none'.
                 
3.530            5/4/92    Added support for 'xxx = none' resource
                 file entry so Dynamix can avoid showing the mouse and
                 memory menus.
                 
3.521            4/30/92   Made so "Make boot disk" is never default
                 choice.
                 
3.520            4/27/92   Added 'if exist'.
                 
3.511            4/24/92   Fixed another bug where previous install's
                 config files weren't read properly.
                 
3.510            4/24/92   Added concatenation capability to copy
                 command.

                      When checking for extended memory capability and
                 0 is reported free, see if someone else might be
                 using it; otherwise, say the user doesn't have
                 extended memory capability.  Takes care of cosmetic
                 problem where a '286 with no extended memory allows
                 user to "use extra memory" (even though the game
                 would not actually try to use it).
                 
3.20             7/15/91   Converted to acompact model to make more
                 memory available.  This increased the size of the

3.13                  Fixed some bugs having to do with long text
                 messages (observed when testing Spanish language
                 version).  Improved detection of full target disk.
                 
3.12                  Made the order of driver menu choices dependent
                 on the order of the associated entries in
                 INSTALL.HLP.
                 
                      Added autodetection for audio (Chris Smith).
                 
3.11                  Added floppy = yes entry to default config file.

                 config file.
