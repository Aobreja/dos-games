CAESAR II ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Last Revised September 15, 1995
--------------------------------

Revisions to the Manual
-----------------------
The following game elements were modified after our manual 
went to press.  (These changes are reflected in the game's 
on-line help.)

P. 25 (Build Buttons) -- You can only build a limited length 
of road, wall or aqueduct by dragging the mouse between two 
points.

P. 34 (Businesses) -- When you select the Industry icon on 
the City Level, businesses that are currently supplied from 
the province are listed in green; businesses that are not 
supplied are listed in red.  This does not apply when 
playing in City Only mode.

P. 45 (Walkers) -- Walkers pass their benefits to any people 
within three squares of them.  Also, they have a limited 
lifespan.

P. 61 (Training Troops) -- Once troops become trained, they 
will be added to existing Cohorts that have been ordered to 
Return to Fort, or have moved over their fort, within the 
past few months.

P. 62 (Cohort Recruitment) -- By default, new recruits are 
sent equally into Cohorts, one assigned to each Fort you 
have built on the Province Level. You may expand or diminish 
a Cohort through the button on the Cohort information panel. 
The "Normal" setting recruits an equal proportion of new 
troops (relative to the other Cohorts), the "Major" setting 
sets a larger proportion, and the "Minor" setting sets a 
smaller one. Setting a Cohort to "Demobilize" makes the 
Cohort inactive (allowing its troops to be retrained into 
other cohorts) until you mobilize it again.

P. 72 (Battle Screen) -- There are two zoom levels to the 
battle screen, not three.

P. 73 (Unit Information) -- You can also select enemy units 
to view their stats in this box, but you cannot select both 
your units and the enemy's at the same time.

P. 74 (Ordering Formations) -- After ordering a formation, 
you MUST SELECT A LOCATION for that formation by clicking on 
the battlefield.

P. 89 (City Business Types) -- There are no lumber mills or 
timber in the game.  However, tailors and wool have been 
added to the game.
